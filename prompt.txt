ok, so i'm thinking of how layout is gonna work on conceptual
level. here are my thought:

Every component needs to know parent height and width. For Column
and Row it can also be the height/width of the terminal. For
Input, Button and Text it will be width/height of Column or Row.
Each components needs to know some data:
- Column/Row: parent W/H, alignement (like
justify-between/center/ .. ), padding and gap
Text: parent W/H (text length is not necessary as it will be
cut off always; it should alse must be able to handle multiline
based on pW/pH)
- Button: pW, pH, own width and height (maybe padding is better)
- Input: pW, pH (pH is needed if it's multiline input)

As you can see Text, Input, Button all need parent width and
height from parents (pW, pH).

Another important topic is about width. I want to be able to have
a Row with Input taking 70% and Button 30% and resize. I imagine
this can be done by passing pW*0.7 or pW*0.3 to children (Input)
from parent (Row). So I want to be able to RECALCULATE the layout
whenever pW, pH changes (+ when inner Component state changes).

To summarize, we have a tree like structure where we pass down
some data from parents to calculate the layout. Now I have no
idea how to represent all that in the code.

MY QUESTION:
Without going into implementation details yet, give me some hints
on how should I approach painting process?
(If I understand right, in my previous messy approach I was
painting while doing layout)
